In the spring, we'll start mowing your lawn at a lower height. In order to combat the sun, your grass should be cut higher as the temperatures rise. We mow your lawn very high during the hot summer months to keep it as lush and green as possible.As the weather cools in the fall, we'll gradually start cutting the lawn a little shorter each week. Please contact our office if you would like your lawn cut higher or lower at any time, and we will do our best to cut your lawn to the height you want. This can be more difficult for bi-weekly cuts at certain times of the year.</p></div>

                        <div class="bg-faded p-5 rounded"><p class="mb-0">It is very common for lawn equipment to damage sprinkler heads. Irrigation systems, like most other systems on your house, require routine maintenance. When the ground shifts and pushes the heads into a more hazardous location than when they were originally mounted, and when the spring-loaded sprinkler head wears out, these are the two most common causes of irrigation damage.Both of these issues are common in even the most pristine landscapes. Don't panic if your sprinkler head has broken! Simply mark the broken head with everything from an irrigation flag to a chopstick, call our office, and we'll come out right away to patch it. This does not need you to be at home.</p></div>

This generally requires us making good judgment calls on when to mow. During the months when your lawn is actively growing, it is preferable for us to come out and mow the lawn wet rather than skipping the lawn and risking it going weeks without a hack. Ruts can happen at any time.It's possible that ruts could form in your lawn if it's wet when you mow it. Almost all of these ruts are just temporary and will disappear as the lawn dries out.
                        If your lawn becomes too wet to mow on your scheduled day, please contact us immediately and we will gladly pause your operation.We do our utmost to make the best choice for our clients, but due to the subjectivity of this type of scenario, doing it right every time for each client's needs can be difficult.</p></div>

If your fence has pickets with grass going along them instead of some kind of runner it is very common for trimmer line from the weed eater to create a line and eventual divot in the fence pickets that gets worse over time.A board on board fence makes this even more likely if there is not a runner at the bottom of the fence.
                        The most popular source of damage is gates. If you ever have a question about your fence or suspect harm, please contact our office as soon as possible, and we will send someone out to assess the situation and schedule any necessary repairs.</p></div>
